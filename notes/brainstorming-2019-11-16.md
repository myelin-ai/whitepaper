## On communication

- An organism has different channels/frequences, on which it can broadcast information.
- There have to be mechanisms in place that encourage frugal of resources. Otherwise, there will be too much noise, too large genomes and too complex brains. Too much noise will hinder any evolutionary driven inprovements.
- Communication over multiple channels and also over increased distances shall use more resources.

## On combinations

The system of modular concepts such as which SNN mechanism to use, how to approach STDP or how to build brains from genes has to be individually testable to enable comparisons between combinations of systems.

## On locomotion

To encourage precise and determined movement, locomotion is locked behind resources. Moving further distances per tick increases the resource cost exponentially. (To do Mafi: Why linear cost for movement is not an option). Moving through obstacles such as plants increases the resource cost by a obstacle specific multiplier.

## On metabolism

To discourage fully passive behavior and force confrontation with changing environments, a metabolism-like mechanism is in place. The organism's current resource level ("energy") will decrease over time. It can be increased by consuming either plants or other organisms.
