\section{Environment}

\subsection{Separation of mind and body}
In our only role model for General Intelligence, the human brain, a separation of the mind and
the body it is residing in is unfeasable~\cite{Dudai2014}. If we believe that nature is a good 
indicator for the necessary attributes of General Intelligence, the concequent thing to do is not 
abstract away the bodily environment and its steering needs that gave rise to the mind in the first place~\cite{Jekely2010}. 
A simulation capable of producing AGI must therefore in our opinion contain not only ``brains in jars'', but 
also provide a body with which a simulated organism can interact with other organisms in a social manner and a 
sandbox-like environment that is susceptible to change.
But how far should such a simulation go? Which attributes of the real world are worth simulating in a way 
that contributes to the emergence of AGI\@?

\subsection{Social interaction}
The human brain does not only thrive on sensory input, it
\emph{demands} interaction. Deprived of these stimulations,
the brain suffers damage and enforces sensory feedback by employing
hallucinations~\cite{Grassian2006}. From this, we can infer that
our simulation must provide organisms with information about their surroundings.
This includes the ability to communicate with other organisms over some
kind of arbitrary protocol. By emiting own messages over the protocol and
rewarding organisms that adhere to instructions broadcasted in this manner,
we can steer how the organisms interpret and shape this common ``language''.

\subsection{Life-sustaining ressources}
In order to encourage neuroplasticity and adaptivity, the organisms should be 
forced out of their comfort zone, as they could stagnate otherwise.
To achieve this, the environment continuously alters itself to shift its ressources.
Another great booster of evolution is competition in a predator-prey environment~\cite{Dawkins1982}.
Both of these concepts can be described in nature as a concequence of the need for ressources 
used in building survival machines, in Dawkin's words. 
By introducing the idea of depleting ressources in organisms that are necessary for survival, 
i.e. \emph{energy}, we can guide their behaviour by placing objects inside the world which organisms can consume
in order to regain energy. The initial energy sources conceived by us are \emph{plants} and \emph{water}.


The concept of water is simplified for our purposes as a static, lake-like body of water.
This ressource is generated sparsely at central positions and will not be removed uppon consumption.
Organisms are forced to interact with each other by the collectiv need to gather water at the same locations.

Plants are used to naturally controll populations
