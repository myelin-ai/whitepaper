\section{Evolution}

As we had discovered in earlier work, combining complex neural networks 
with genetic algorithms can easily push the computational cost of advancement
beyond any reasonable limit~\cite{Ferner2017}.
To avoid this pitfall we can use the extra encoding potential provided by 
the addition of time as an input of our neural network's state~\cite{Paugam-Moisy2012}.
