\section{Genetics}

As we have discovered in earlier work, combining complex neural networks 
with genetic algorithms can easily push the computational cost of advancement
beyond any reasonable limit~\cite{Ferner2017}.
To avoid this pitfall we can use the extra encoding potential provided by 
the addition of time as an input of our neural network's state~\cite{Paugam-Moisy2012}.

\subsection{Genome}
Our genome consists of Cluster \& Hox Genes.
These represent the information which is required to build the neural network.

\subsubsection{Cluster Genes}
Cluster Genes act as a blueprint for a set of neurons and their connections, which we call a cluster.

\subsubsection{Hox Genes}
Hox Genes make up the building plan for the neural network,
specifying how clusters should be placed and connected.

We define three cluster genes and four hox genes.
