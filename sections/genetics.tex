\section{Genetics}

As we have discovered in earlier work, combining complex neural networks 
with genetic algorithms can easily push the computational cost of advancement
beyond any reasonable limit~\cite{Ferner2017}.
To avoid this pitfall we can use the extra encoding potential provided by 
the addition of time as an input of our neural network's state~\cite{Paugam-Moisy2012}.

\subsection{Genome}
Our genome consists of Cluster \& Hox Genes.
These represent the information which is required to build the neural network.

\subsubsection{Cluster Genes}
Cluster Genes act as a blueprint for a set of neurons and their connections, which we call a cluster.

\paragraph{Explaining Important Terms}
Placement Neuron: The neuron of the cluster that will be shared with the cluster that it is attached to. Instead of placing a new neuron, a neuron of an already placed cluster is being used as a substitute. See the \emph{Target Neuron} of the Hox Gene for more information.

\subsubsection{Hox Genes}
Hox Genes make up the building plan for the neural network,
specifying how clusters should be placed and connected.

\paragraph{Explaining Important Terms}
Target Neuron: Refers to a neuron on a cluster that has already been placed.

\subsection{Example of a genome}
We define three cluster genes and four hox genes.

\paragraph{Naming of Neurons}
Naming neurons uniquely without creating confusion is hard. We decided to use the $i$ prefix for cluster definitions (read $i_0$ as \emph{neuron with the index 0 on the cluster}).
Once a cluster is placed, we name the neurons in the order they have been placed in the network. As a prefix, we decided to use $n$. You can read $n_0$ as \emph{neuron with the index 0}.
