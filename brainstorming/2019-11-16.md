## On communication

- An organism has different channels/frequences, on which it can broadcast information.
- There have to be mechanisms in place that encourage frugal of ressources. Otherwise, there will be too much noise, too large genomes and too complex brains. Too much noise will hinder any evolutionary driven inprovements.
- Communication over multiple channels and also over increased distances shall use more ressources.

## On combinations

The system of modular concepts such as which SNN mechanism to use, how to approach STDP or how to build brains from genes has to be individually testable to enable comparisons between combinations of systems.
